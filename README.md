# Overview

As a computer science student seeking to expand my skills, I developed a software application using the R language to demonstrate proficiency in data mining techniques, specifically association rule learning with the Apriori algorithm. The software reads transaction data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, runs the Apriori algorithm to discover association rules, and then tests these rules based on user-defined itemsets and outcomes.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of the R programming language syntax and its applications in data mining and analysis. By building this application, I aimed to strengthen my knowledge of working with data frames, applying algorithms, and interpreting the results for actionable insights.

# Development Environment

For developing this software, I used RStudio as my primary integrated development environment (IDE). RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for writing, testing, and debugging R code efficiently.

The programming language used for this project is R. Additionally, the software utilizes the following libraries:
- `arules`: for association rule learning and mining

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites helpful:
- [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/): Comprehensive documentation for R functions and packages.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Community-driven platform for asking programming-related questions and finding solutions to common issues.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to enhance the software by:
- Implementing visualization of association rules for better interpretation.
- Adding support for more advanced data preprocessing techniques.
- Optimizing the code for better performance with larger datasets.
- Enhancing the user interface for easier interaction and customization.
- Integrating additional algorithms for comparison and analysis.
